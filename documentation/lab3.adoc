= Lab3 - Checkpoint Cybersecurity environment automatic configuration

== 1 - Overview

In the previous section, we deployed our lab infrastructure environment, but is deployed by default, no customizations neither updates or installation of packages are performed in the systems deployed.

In this point of the lab, we have already deployed two RHELs (for our apps), a Windows10 for connecting to our environment, and the two Checkpoints (SMS and GW).

Now it's time to configure the Checkpoint environments in order to update their systems to the latest security package and enable the API to interact through Ansible and also with Checkpoint SmartConsole (that will be installed with Ansible also to the Windows10 system).

=== 1.1 - Goals

* Configure and enable the Windows10 VM with Winrm for manage it with Ansible
* Automatically install all the packages needed in the Windows10 (SmartConsole among others)
* Install & Update the Checkpoint Secure Management Server (SMS) with the latest Jumbo Hotfix
* Enable the API for the Checkpoint SMS
* Add Checkpoint Security Gateway to the Checkpoint SMS and Establish trusted connection
* Check SmartConsole connection and investigate the Checkpoint Management Console

== 2 - Lab Specifications

=== 2.1 - Time to complete the lab (approx)

* 25 mins

=== 2.2 - Resources involved

* User Web Browser
* Ansible Tower Portal
* Windows 10
* Windows 10 Powershell

== 3 - Step by Step Guide

In this lab we will enable the Winrm to manage with Ansible the Windows10, automatically install the needed packages and software for the lab in the Win10 VM, config the Checkpoint SMS to enable the api and install the latest security packages (Jumbo Hotfix), configure the Checkpoint GW with to be the default gw for the RHEL systems and check that everything is ok with the SmartConsole management console.

Let's start!

=== 3.1 - Enable WINRM [Windows10] 

For Ansible to communicate to a Windows host and use Windows modules, the Windows host must meet these requirements:

* Ansible can generally manage Windows versions under current and extended support from Microsoft. Ansible can manage desktop OSs including Windows 7, 8.1, and 10, and server OSs including Windows Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019.

* Ansible requires PowerShell 3.0 or newer and at least .NET 4.0 to be installed on the Windows host.

* A WinRM listener should be created and activated. More details for this can be found below.

We accomplished the first two requirements (Windows10 and Powershell3.0 + .Net4.0), but we need to enable WinRM to be able to manage through Ansible the Windows VM.

To do this task we can install automatically a script that installs and enables this. This is well documented in the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_setup.html#winrm-setup[Enable WinRM in Ansible for Windows Documentation].

So for enable this, inside of the Windows 10 (connected by RDP), copy and paste this in a Powershell shell:

```
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
$file = "$env:temp\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

NOTE: If you have trouble with the copy paste open this url in the Windows browser and copy paste it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/master/ansible/files/configure_winrm.ps1

At Set-Execution Policy RemoteSigned you need to press Enter to launched that command in powershell

Press [Y] word to accept the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7[Set-Execution Policy RemoteSigned] to enable the remote execution of Scripts.

NOTE: This is the only manual step in the whole lab, and it's because Azure has some security limitations in order to enable by default the WinRM, to avoid security flaws.

</p>
++++

And that's it for the configuration of the WinRM. Now we can execute all the automations to this Win10 VMs from our AnsibleTower.


=== 3.3 - Config Win10 - Putty + SmartConsole

We need some additional packages for accomplishing this scenario, and we could install by hand. But this is boring, no? Why not add this required software in an automated way with Ansible?

Let's do it!

Go to Ansible Tower and execute the Job Template of **Lab3_config_win10_vm**:

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_2.png">
</p>
++++

This will trigger an automation (based in https://github.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/blob/master/ansible/config_win10_vm.yml[this playbooks]) that will connect to the Win10 and execute some tasks:

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_3.png">
</p>
++++

These tasks are:

* Install Visual C++ Redistributable 2010
* Install Visual C++ Redistributable 2012
* Install Visual C++ Redistributable 2017
* Install Putty (for ssh sessions)
* Download Smartconsole installer from a Azure Blobstore
* Install the SmartConsole package in the system.

In the last task will take a bit for the installation, so in the Win10 open the task manager and check the status of the installer:

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="../documentation/images/lab3_4.png">
</p>
++++

Finally after the process you will have all the software installed in your win10.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="200" src="../documentation/images/lab3_5.png">
</p>
++++

And the most important package: the Checkpoint SmartConsole

endif::[]


=== 3.5 - Config Checkpoint Secure Management Server Environment

Now that we have the configured software packages in our Windows10, and we're able to connect to the checkpoint systems.

But first we need to download and install the Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator and enable the API to be able to use the latest modules from Ansible (executed in Ansible Tower).

https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk153152[Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator] is an accumulation of stability and quality fixes resolving multiple issues in different products. This Incremental Hotfix and this article are periodically updated with new fixes.

Execute **Lab3_1_Workflow_config_sms_checkpoint_environment** Workflow Template (based in the https://github.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/tree/master/ansible/roles/ckp[roles] of checkpoint develop for this lab)

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="../documentation/images/lab3_7.png">
</p>
++++

This will trigger a workflow template job that will have 2 job templates in order (**NO execute them individually**):


* https://github.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/blob/master/ansible/config_ckp_jumbo_hotfix.yml[Lab3_config_ckp_jumbo_hotfix]

* https://github.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/blob/master/ansible/config_ckp_setting_api_sms.yml[Lab3_config_ckp_setting_api_sms]

The image below is the two Job Templates that will be executed.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_8.png">
</p>
++++

IMPORTANT: The Config Jumbo Hotfix takes some time (18mins approx), so its perfect time to grab a coffee and take a small break, or review the video demo below. Check the logs of the Ansible Tower also in order to review the progress (the Check Status of the API is always slowly in non baremetal environments)

We need some additional packages for accomplishing this scenario, and we could install by hand. But this is boring, no? Why not add this required software in an automated way with Ansible?

==== 3.6 Video Demonstration - Install & Update Checkpoint Jumbo Hotfix and Enable API

* Video Demo:

=== 3.7 - Check Checkpoint SMS though SmartConsole and GAIA.

Now that we have already set up the Security Management Server with the latest security package, and enabled the API, we need to access to the SmartConsole of the Checkpoint SMS and also to the console of GAIA system.

==== 3.7.1 - GAIA Mode

Open a browser in the Windows 10 VM and go to the Checkpoint SMS IP:

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_9.png">
</p>
++++

NOTE: Remember that you DON'T use this IP, instead use your specific Checkpoint SMS IP from your vars file or your inventory in Tower.

The credentials are:

```
Username: admin
Password: <password_for_checkpoint>>
```

Once you are logged in you will have access to the GAIA portal.

NOTE: In this portal we will check some parameters of OS from Checkpoint SMS, but if you need to to manage the Policies, Rules, etc, you need to have installed the SmartConsole in order  (like the VMware "heavy" client).

IMPORTANT: After you finished, **you need to exit the session** in order to not lock down the same when the SmartConsole is opened.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_10.png">
</p>
++++

Exit the session, clicking the exit button, next the admin user in the top right corner.

==== 3.7.2 - SmartConsole Mode

SmartConsole is a GUI client you use to manage the Security Gateway (Define Policies, Rules, ... etc)

Go to the SmartConsole R80.30 (Pink Crown icon) and click on it.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="100" src="../documentation/images/lab3_6.png">
</p>
++++

```
Username: admin
Password: <password_for_checkpoint>>
Server_Name: "Check IP Inventory Host in Tower"
```

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_11.png">
</p>
++++

NOTE: Remember that the IP is only orientative. Check your lab ip in the vars or in your inventory.

* First connection to server
* Fingerprint Validation

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../documentation/images/lab3_12.png">
</p>
++++

* Click Proceed

* Close "What's New Pop Up Icon"

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="../documentation/images/lab3_14.png">
</p>
++++

* Check Gateways & Servers

* Check Security Policies

* Click Button "+" and check that only the Predefined policies(Standard) are present

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="../documentation/images/lab3_13.png">
</p>
++++

Check that only the object of the SMS is present. NO Secure Gateway is still present because it's not added yet. 

=== 3.8 - Add Checkpoint Gateway to the Gateway SMS

As we checked in the SmartConsole in the Checkpoint Management console, only the Checkpoint SMS was added in the first place. So now, we need to add the Checkpoint Secure Gateway to the system, and 

Execute the Lab3_2_Workflow_config_gw_to_checkpoint_environment Workflow Template:

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="../documentation/images/lab3_15.png">
</p>
++++

This will trigger two job templates:

* https://github.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/blob/master/ansible/config_ckp_add_simple_gw.yml[Lab3_config_add_simple_gw]

* https://github.com/rcarrata/ansiblefest2020-secdemo/blob/master/ansible/config_ckp_add_route_default_gw.yml[Lab3_config_ckp_add_route_default_gw]


++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="../documentation/images/lab3_16.png">
</p>
++++

Check that in the SmartConsole, in the Gateway & Servers section that the Checkpoint GW appeared. 

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" src="../documentation/images/lab3_17.png">
</p>
++++

NOTE: Don't worry for the Status with the icon of a Warning, because these are using trial licenses.

Click it, and pop up the new dialog to show that the Secure Internal Communication have "Trust Established" in the box. This is because the link between Checkpoint SMS and the GW has established correctly a secure communication between them.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" src="../documentation/images/lab3_18.png">
</p>
++++

Now we have all the Checkpoint systems up & running, and everything is ready to work automating and securing our applications.
